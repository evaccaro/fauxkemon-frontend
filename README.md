# Fauxkemon

Fauxkemon is a pokémon battle simulator. Players can choose pokémon, battle, and level-up.

## Pokémon Selection

After selecting a username, players can choose from one of three pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.

## Battle

Once a pokémon is selected, battle begins! Players go against one of nine different random pokémon. The player can perform one of two options, attack or run. If the enemy pokémon is too powerful, running may be the best option.

If the players hit points (HP) drops below 0, the game is over. If the player successfully defeats the enemy pokémon, they gain experience points (XP) and go on to fight another random pokémon.

## Evolution

After gaining the required amount of XP, the players pokémon evolves. There are three levels of evolution for each pokémon. The goal is to complete all evolutions.
